# What have we here? Wallpapers?
This is just a personal collection of wallpapers compiled from [orangc's walls](https://github.com/orangci/walls), [gruvbox wallpapers](https://gruvbox-wallpapers.pages.dev/) and [zhichaoh's wallpapers](https://github.com/zhichaoh/catppuccin-wallpapers) with a few additions from my own collection. I will be updating the repo sporadically if I find notable additions.
Any artists and photographers who's works can be found in this repo will have their socials linked in the "Thanks and credits" as well as the location of their works.

No fancy previews here to slow down the loading of the page, all of that is in the file viewer, go there to find something you like. I've specifically organised the repo so that there arent that many folder trees, and so that every folder does not have a paralysing amount of images
# Thanks and credits
- [Josh Van Zuylen](### [Josh Van Zuylen](https://www.artstation.com/joshvanzuylen)) for the wonderful renders of the Phoenix in the *space* folder




> Disclaimer: These wallpapers are sourced from many, many, many sources on the internet. I did not make any of these. Zero credit belongs to me in that regard, this is simply a somewhat curated collection. If you are the artist or photographer of one of these wallpapers, please leave an issue on the issues page, I will happily take the wallpaper down or add credit in this README.
